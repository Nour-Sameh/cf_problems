# 🚀 Codeforces Problem Solving

This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces problems.  
Each solution is implemented in **C++** with an emphasis on efficiency and readability.

## 📂 Structure
- Each solution is stored in a separate file named after the problem name.  
- Code is written with proper input handling and optimized logic.  

## 🛠️ Compilation & Execution
To compile and run a solution using **g++**:  
```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 problem.cpp -o problem && ./problem
